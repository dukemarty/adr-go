## Raison d'Ãªtre

The reason for yet another implementation was basically that at work the phodal tooling was introduced to manage ADRs for our projects, but in general I was not happy with the performance and the user experience I had with it. A Go implementation, which results in a single executable (thereby allowing a simple copy-install instead of something more complex) appealed to me, but my primary requirement was compatibility with the folder and file structures introduced and used by the _adr-tools_.

Of course, this does not mean any critique on any of those other tools, but just that for my use case and my user preferences, this
